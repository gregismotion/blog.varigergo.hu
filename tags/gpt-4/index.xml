<p>&hellip; Deckard arrived at the towering Tyrell Corporation building, nervous about meeting Eldon Tyrell, the CEO and inventor of the replicants. Tyrell welcomed him into his lavish office and expressed his interest in seeing the Voight-Kampff test fail as a method to discover these machines. He asked the detective to try it on his beautiful assistant, Rachael, who appeared entirely human.</p>
<p>The Voight-Kampff test, designed to measure emotional responses, typically took about 20–30 questions. Deckard’s attempt on Rachael took much longer than that. She appeared to struggle with certain questions, and her responses were erratic. He concluded privately with the CEO that her assistant was a replicant who believed she was human.</p>
<p>Tyrell confirmed the detective’s suspicions and explained that Rachael was an experiment, a new type of replicant created with a &ldquo;more human than human&rdquo; motto. She had been implanted with false memories to provide an &ldquo;emotional cushion&rdquo; and prevent her from realizing she was a replicant. Rachael had no knowledge of her true nature and had been living as a human for years.</p>
<p>Deckard felt uneasy about the revelation. He had always considered himself a hunter of non-human beings, but Rachael’s case blurred the line between human and replicant. He left the office, deep in thought about what it meant to be human and what kind of future awaited Rachael and others like her.</p>
<p>Based on Blade Runner&rsquo;s story</p>

<p>As you know, I want to sell online, and I hate using centralized (and unnecessarily expensive) services, so I had to write my own small backend to handle Stripe payments coming in. The SDK is available in many languages, but for learning, I picked up Ruby. The problem is, it would’ve taken at least days to get up and running with my own code from scratch. Luckily, I’ve got an idea.</p>
<h1 id="the-feared-ai">The feared AI</h1>
<p>I went onto ChatGPT and told it to handle Stripe payments with Ruby and then send a request to Mautic with the payment information. It literally did it. No hassle, no nothing; I only had to do some touch-ups (and I obviously had to setup a VPS beforehand). Is it perfect code? Probably not, but I’ve never seen a human write something flawless for the first time.</p>
<h1 id="do-we-even-need-programmers">Do we even need programmers?</h1>
<p>Sort of. You see, at the moment, this is a great guiding tool. Yeah, it will surely develop. It will get to a point where I will tell it what to do, and it will even handle the VPS creation. Still, someone needs to supervise this process; heck, someone needs to tell it the goals.</p>
<h1 id="programming-is-dead-long-live-programming">Programming is dead. Long live programming!</h1>
<p>Traditional programming has ceased to exist. Isn’t programming just telling instructions to a computer (a very simplified description)? Just because we’ve made a (sort of) compiler that can translate English to specific instructions, that notion didn’t change. We’re just going to an even higher level than, let’s say, Python!</p>
<p>What I just outlined is still the future. For now, it’s a great helping tool.</p>
<p>&hellip; and I plan to use it. I’ve applied to Github’s student program to get free access to their new tool, and I also found a vim plugin.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: Github doesn’t really want me in their student program, as I&rsquo;ve already been rejected. I’ll be sure to try again, but their process is very bad for smaller schools. Also, they could be clearer on the problems they&rsquo;ve had with my application. I can still test Copilot; there’s a 30-day trial.</em></p>
