<p>Meet Godot 4, the newest release of this 2D/3D game engine. It&rsquo;s always been said that open-source and free software is somehow worse in quality than for-profit programs. First of all, free software CAN be for-profit. Free licenses only require that you pass on the code to your buyer.</p>
<p>Second of all, if you check out Godot, it&rsquo;s got many features that are on-par with the big players.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t really feel like playing games anymore, and making them isn&rsquo;t very profitable either. Don&rsquo;t think that these engines can only be used for traditional &ldquo;games&rdquo;. Many programs require advanced graphics, and Godot is very extensible.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re really grateful for freedom, fight for it.</p>
