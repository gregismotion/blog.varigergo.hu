<h1 id="it-could-only-be-worse">It could only be worse</h1>
<p>You see, I&rsquo;m reading that many new sites like Twitter want to launch. WHY? WHY DO THE SAME OVER AND OVER AGAIN? Bring something new to the table.</p>
<h1 id="uncensorable-social-media">Uncensorable social media?</h1>
<p>You see, with decentralized solutions like Mastodon (and other ActivityPub compatible software). We can achieve this. Every instance can freely block/whitelist other nodes as they please. Echo chamber will still pop-up: but you can more clearly navigate them.</p>
<h1 id="metas-comeback">Meta&rsquo;s comeback?</h1>
<p>Facebook&rsquo;s parent company Meta is planning to launch an ActivityPub compatible service. Will it fail, will they ruin it? Maybe, but atleast they&rsquo;re dipping their toes in new warers.</p>
<p>Elon, make Twitter ActivityPub compatible. Thank you.</p>
