It&amp;rsquo;s a device made exactly to keep you occupied.
We&amp;rsquo;ve got work to do!
But where?&amp;hellip;
Change up your old and boring environment.
Go to the kitchen, Starbucks, outside or I don&amp;rsquo;t care.
It will keep you away from old bad habits that come from pesky little associations.
So, keep your bed for sleep.
Obviously, you know when to do that as you will&amp;hellip;</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First of all, put your phone in another room.</p>

<p>Obviously, you know when to do that as you will&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;allocate time for EVERY task.</p>
<p>Become a TERMINATOR and eliminate everything you need to do in a day.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also become better at estimating time frames</p>
<p>PLUS you&rsquo;ll not waste time such as&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;such as with social media.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t scroll Instagram, not even in your breaks.</p>
<p>That shit fries your brain, like an egg in a pan.</p>

It&amp;rsquo;s all crumbling under its own weight. Outdated tools, outdated information
No one has ever told you anything about the real world.
You were only told that you needed to memorize this verse and that verse.
You&amp;rsquo;re also irresponsible and a terrible, unethical human being for even thinking your time is worth something.
You&amp;rsquo;ve been told you can&amp;rsquo;t schedule your time, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry; they&amp;rsquo;ll handle that for you.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine that you&rsquo;re in a hopeless education system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all crumbling under its own weight. Outdated tools, outdated information</p>
<p>No one has ever told you anything about the real world.</p>
<p>You were only told that you needed to memorize this verse and that verse.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also irresponsible and a terrible, unethical human being for even thinking your time is worth something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been told you can&rsquo;t schedule your time, but don&rsquo;t worry; they&rsquo;ll handle that for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not yet restricted in what we say, but does it even have any meaning to talk if no one listens?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the situation of the average Hungarian student. I&rsquo;ve got to take action; that&rsquo;s what I feel is for the greater good.</p>
<p>I first plan on helping my fellow students survive the current system until something changes. There are ways you can still excel at this system. You can even develop yourself while you&rsquo;re at it.</p>
<p>You see, many people use the system&rsquo;s quality as an excuse to do nothing useful in life. That&rsquo;s the worst attitude I could imagine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the game; blame the player.</p>
<p><a href="https://iskolahack.hu">Join IskolaHACK, a new and upcoming community for Hungarian students.</a>
(The URL might not be yet active; I&rsquo;ve got to get through some bureaucracy with .hu domains.)</p>
<p>My primary platform for this brand will be Instagram, as I know most of my fellow students use it daily. There&rsquo;s also TikTok, but more on that later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/iskolahack/">I made a new project that utilizes OpenAI&rsquo;s new GPT and Dall-E 2 models for text and image generation. See the results for yourself on Instagram.</a></p>
<p>It took half a day, and it works very well.</p>
<p>I automated the text, the hashtags, and even the background image generation.</p>
<p>I still have the ability to curate and choose from variations; I still want it to have a soul.</p>
<p>AI will eradicate many jobs, but you should strive to fill the new roles that&rsquo;ll be needed.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the game; blame the player.</p>
