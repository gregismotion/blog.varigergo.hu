The SDK is available in many languages but for learning I picked up Ruby. Problem is, it would&rsquo;ve taken atleast days to get up and running with my own code from scratch. Luckily, I&rsquo;ve got an idea.</p>
<h1 id="the-feared-ai">The feared AI</h1>
<p>I went onto ChatGPT and told it to handle Stripe payments with Ruby and then send a request to Mautic with the payment informations. It, literally did it. No hassle, no nothing: I only had to do some touch-ups (and I obviously had to setup a VPS beforehand). Is it perfect code? Probably not: but I&rsquo;ve never seen a human write something flawless for the first time&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="do-we-even-need-programmers">Do we even need programmers?</h1>
<p>Sort of. You see at the moment, this is a great guiding tool. Yeah, it will surely develop. It will get to a point when I will tell it what to do and it will even handle the VPS creation. Still, someone needs to supervise this process: heck, someone needs to tell it the goals.</p>
<h1 id="programming-is-dead-long-live-programming">Programming is dead. Long live programming!</h1>
<p>Traditional programming has ceased to exist. Isn&rsquo;t programming just telling instructions to a computer (very much a simplified description)? Just because we&rsquo;ve made a (sort of) compiler that can translate English to specific instructions that notion didn&rsquo;t change. We&rsquo;re just going to an even higher level than let&rsquo;s say Python!</p>
<p>What I just outlined is still the future. For now, it&rsquo;s a great helping tool.</p>
<p>&hellip;and I plan to use it. I&rsquo;ve applied to Github&rsquo;s student program to get free access, while I also found a vim plugin.</p>
<p><em>UPDATE: Github doesn&rsquo;t really want me in their student program as I got rejected already. I&rsquo;ll be sure to try again but their process is very bad for smaller schools. Also, they could be clearer on the problems they&rsquo;ve with my application. I can still test Copilot: there&rsquo;s a 30-day trial.</em></p>
