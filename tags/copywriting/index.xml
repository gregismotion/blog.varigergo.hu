What makes YOU purchase?
&amp;ldquo;Well, I rationally put together the facts, and then&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
No, you don&amp;rsquo;t.
When you click the &amp;ldquo;Buy&amp;rdquo; button, it&amp;rsquo;s an impulsive act.
A quick emotional response.
Triggered by your caveman brain.
Sure, you might rationalize it before and after.
&amp;hellip;but the most important action is based on your sensitive feelings.
Many businesses ignore this fact; ALL of your competitors do.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What makes someone buy a product?</p>

<p>No, you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>When you click the &ldquo;Buy&rdquo; button, it&rsquo;s an impulsive act.</p>

<p>Many businesses ignore this fact; ALL of your competitors do.</p>
<p>Writing is a medium that can heavily influence your emotions, yet it requires more sophistication than film.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t just put in a quick and scary jump scare or a Michael Bay-style explosion.</p>
<p>Wait, I just did, and it played in your head.</p>
<p>Copywriting is an essential skill for making it online or anywhere in the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://varigergo.hu">With that in mind, I hugely reworked my site.</a></p>
<p>P.S. Any feedback is appreciated.</p>

Even if I wanted to, I&amp;rsquo;d not be able to commit to a normal job throughout my school break, so I wanted to focus completely on improving my writing and selling skills.
I definitely know my goal, which is to start creating my foundational income sources to build up my emergency funds and do some good.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One day, as I was coming home from school, I started thinking about what I&rsquo;d pursue in the summer.</p>
<p>Even if I wanted to, I&rsquo;d not be able to commit to a normal job throughout my school break, so I wanted to focus completely on improving my writing and selling skills.</p>
<p>I definitely know my goal, which is to start creating my foundational income sources to build up my emergency funds and do some good.</p>
<p>I never planned on joining Andrew Tate&rsquo;s &ldquo;university&rdquo;, &ldquo;school,&rdquo; or whatever you want to call it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen the potential of networking there, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure if the information was worth my money. Well&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve enrolled in the &ldquo;Copywriting Campus,&rdquo;, and so far it&rsquo;s mostly just Russell Brunson&rsquo;s free book&hellip;</p>
<p>With one important twist: I really love the quick and rapid teaching method they have used so far.
I also like that there&rsquo;s a clear path for you to take.</p>
<p>So far, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like too big of a cult—just a normal online community.
You don&rsquo;t really see Andrew himself either; there are so-called &ldquo;professors&rdquo; who run these campuses.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made one rule to keep my curiosity from getting out of control, which happens a lot: I&rsquo;ll only continue paying if I make back the price of it every month.
Worst-case scenario: I&rsquo;ve wasted my money.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t abuse substances like most Hungarians, so I&rsquo;m sure this cost me less than a smoking addiction.
Obviously, that wouldn&rsquo;t justify this if I paid for nothing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll keep you all updated on this journey.</p>
