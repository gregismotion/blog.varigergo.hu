<p>Have you ever wished for someone to just turn on an annoying hair dryer for hours on your electricity bill?</p>
<p>If yes, you&rsquo;re fucking insane. Hit me up and I&rsquo;ll make sure you&rsquo;ll meet&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;my 2 fellows, who call themselves a certain, very liked ethnicity in Europe.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not mention the fact that they&rsquo;re more white than me.</p>
<p>They wanted to show off their &ldquo;light-skin rizz&rdquo; in the best light possible&hellip;</p>
<p>How do you even lose a FUCKING BIG VACUUM CLEANER?</p>
<p>The host was very happy.</p>
<p>We weren&rsquo;t invited there so far.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to lie, I had a little laugh.</p>
<p>Very little.</p>
<p>Moral of the story, don&rsquo;t bring monkeys if you want to network.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s not a bad idea on a teenage party though.</p>
