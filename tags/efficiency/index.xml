It&amp;rsquo;s all crumbling under its own weight. Outdated tools, outdated information
No one has ever told you anything about the real world.
You were only told that you needed to memorize this verse and that verse.
You&amp;rsquo;re also irresponsible and a terrible, unethical human being for even thinking your time is worth something.
You&amp;rsquo;ve been told you can&amp;rsquo;t schedule your time, but don&amp;rsquo;t worry; they&amp;rsquo;ll handle that for you.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Imagine that you&rsquo;re in a hopeless education system.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all crumbling under its own weight. Outdated tools, outdated information</p>
<p>No one has ever told you anything about the real world.</p>
<p>You were only told that you needed to memorize this verse and that verse.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re also irresponsible and a terrible, unethical human being for even thinking your time is worth something.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve been told you can&rsquo;t schedule your time, but don&rsquo;t worry; they&rsquo;ll handle that for you.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not yet restricted in what we say, but does it even have any meaning to talk if no one listens?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the situation of the average Hungarian student. I&rsquo;ve got to take action; that&rsquo;s what I feel is for the greater good.</p>
<p>I first plan on helping my fellow students survive the current system until something changes. There are ways you can still excel at this system. You can even develop yourself while you&rsquo;re at it.</p>
<p>You see, many people use the system&rsquo;s quality as an excuse to do nothing useful in life. That&rsquo;s the worst attitude I could imagine.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the game; blame the player.</p>
<p><a href="https://iskolahack.hu">Join IskolaHACK, a new and upcoming community for Hungarian students.</a>
(The URL might not be yet active; I&rsquo;ve got to get through some bureaucracy with .hu domains.)</p>
<p>My primary platform for this brand will be Instagram, as I know most of my fellow students use it daily. There&rsquo;s also TikTok, but more on that later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/iskolahack/">I made a new project that utilizes OpenAI&rsquo;s new GPT and Dall-E 2 models for text and image generation. See the results for yourself on Instagram.</a></p>
<p>It took half a day, and it works very well.</p>
<p>I automated the text, the hashtags, and even the background image generation.</p>
<p>I still have the ability to curate and choose from variations; I still want it to have a soul.</p>
<p>AI will eradicate many jobs, but you should strive to fill the new roles that&rsquo;ll be needed.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t blame the game; blame the player.</p>

Checkout, funnels, posts, and everything else, yet something was missing. The actual content: copywriting isn&amp;rsquo;t my favorite activity to do, and I&amp;rsquo;m not that good at it yet. I never thought I would need this skill; after all, I aspired to be only a software engineer.
Now that I dipped my toes into marketing too, I often get into situations where I can&amp;rsquo;t write anything, even when bad copy would be better than none.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yup, my site&rsquo;s code was done. Checkout, funnels, posts, and everything else, yet something was missing. The actual content: copywriting isn&rsquo;t my favorite activity to do, and I&rsquo;m not that good at it yet. I never thought I would need this skill; after all, I aspired to be only a software engineer.</p>
<p>Now that I dipped my toes into marketing too, I often get into situations where I can&rsquo;t write anything, even when bad copy would be better than none. If I put out something, at least there&rsquo;s a slight chance of making conversions.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m planning on is using <a href="https://github.com/vyberd">my Hugo Modules (which new subscribers got for free)</a> and making a tool to let me customize the colors and the copy. Where&rsquo;s the novelty in this? I&rsquo;ll make AI write the first draft of the copy. Obviously, I&rsquo;ll rewrite and change it to make it actually have soul. Still, a script template can go a long way.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for this. Also, I want to make my school life easier with AI too.</p>

I quickly thought up ideas for my essay about that historical event. 10 minutes spent. I thought I had it all, I just needed to write it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to slow myself down by opening a text editor and then copying it into Google Classroom, so I decided to jump right in. BIG MISTAKE, KIDDO! &amp;ldquo;You need to login to your account&amp;rdquo; Yeah, sure.</description><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I only had 20 minutes, and the deadline approaches. I quickly thought up ideas for my essay about that historical event. 10 minutes spent. I thought I had it all, I just needed to write it. I didn&rsquo;t want to slow myself down by opening a text editor and then copying it into Google Classroom, so I decided to jump right in. BIG MISTAKE, KIDDO! &ldquo;You need to login to your account&rdquo; Yeah, sure. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your 2FA code?&rdquo; and &ldquo;We need to confirm your recovery address&rdquo;. LET. ME. WORK. 7 minutes left.</p>
<p>&hellip;then I &ldquo;quickly&rdquo; jumped into Classroom: 10 seconds just to see my classes, around 2 minutes just to get to the assignment. 4 minutes left; now I just need to open Google Docs: loading, loading, and loading&hellip; It didn&rsquo;t finish; I had to reload the document again. I had 2 minutes to write my actual essay.</p>
<h1 id="painful-to-be-productive">Painful to be productive</h1>
<p>Ah yeah, j-just let me open a big web app to send a message. Yeah-yeah, no rush: I&rsquo;ll just buy the latest CPU to get speeds that are ACCEPTABLE. Why do you even care about RAM usage? Every computer has, like, 64GB of it or what.</p>
<p>I despise this cowardly attitude: b-but it costs too much to optimize. No, it doesn&rsquo;t, dumbwit. Hardware is going in the direction of smaller and more efficient, so expect less and less RAM and weaker and weaker CPUs. Expect monochrome e-reader or RLCD displays to go mainstream. We&rsquo;re only going to get more minimalistic, so get on with the times and leave that idiotic Electron app behind.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you what&rsquo;s the best and most productive interface: a terminal, a command-line. &ldquo;B-but that&rsquo;s not user-friendly; average people can&rsquo;t use it.&rdquo; So what? Average people can only use a mouse because they&rsquo;ve learned it. &ldquo;Just ummm, let me click 3 buttons that are each placed in different locations to do this one thing.&rdquo; I just can&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t tolerate &ldquo;user-friendly&rdquo; interfaces.</p>
<p>I got into vim (my favorite and superior text editor), wrote here for a few minutes, pressed a few keys, and published the post to my blog.</p>
<p>Sadly, after that, I&rsquo;ll have to use the shitty Twitter interface; and actually wait for it to load. Ah yeah, all modern sites are slow just because we&rsquo;re putting unnecessary stuff in them. But that&rsquo;s for another day&hellip;</p>
