Checkout, funnels, posts, and everything else, yet something was missing. The actual content: copywriting isn&rsquo;t my favorite activity to do, and I&rsquo;m not that good at it yet. I never thought I would need this skill; after all, I aspired to be only a software engineer.</p>
<p>Now that I dipped my toes into marketing too, I often get into situations where I can&rsquo;t write anything, even when bad copy would be better than none. If I put out something, at least there&rsquo;s a slight chance of making conversions.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m planning on is using <a href="https://github.com/vyberd">my Hugo Modules (which new subscribers got for free)</a> and making a tool to let me customize the colors and the copy. Where&rsquo;s the novelty in this? I&rsquo;ll make AI write the first draft of the copy. Obviously, I&rsquo;ll rewrite and change it to make it actually have soul. Still, a script template can go a long way.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for this. Also, I want to make my school life easier with AI too.</p>
