What makes YOU purchase?
&amp;ldquo;Well, I rationally put together the facts, and then&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
No, you don&amp;rsquo;t.
When you click the &amp;ldquo;Buy&amp;rdquo; button, it&amp;rsquo;s an impulsive act.

&amp;hellip;but the most important action is based on your sensitive feelings.

<p>I can&rsquo;t just put in a quick and scary jump scare or a Michael Bay-style explosion.</p>
<p>Wait, I just did, and it played in your head.</p>
<p>Copywriting is an essential skill for making it online or anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>P.S. Any feedback is appreciated.</p>
