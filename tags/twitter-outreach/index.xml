Anyways&amp;hellip;
I&amp;rsquo;ve been in The Real World for almost a month.
Exactly MINUS $49.99 is in my pocket.
Not a big achievement.
&amp;ldquo;Why am I doing it?&amp;rdquo; you ask.
My copywriting has gotten way better.

<p>But a lot better than what I had before.</p>
<p>IGNORANCE.</p>
<p>And you know what else I was not paying attention to?</p>
<p>Business principles.</p>
<p>You can blast them into your life.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also very good to learn the productivity hacks in there.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I was too lazy to write a to-do list until now.</p>
<p>Again, nothing on these campuses is new information.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s presented in an awesome way.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be here next month again.</p>
<p>My plan is to make this at least self-sustaining.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see what I do next time.</p>
